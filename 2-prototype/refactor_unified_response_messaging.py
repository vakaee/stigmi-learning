"""
Refactor unified response messaging to fix:
1. Extract anti-hallucination rules to top (DRY)
2. Remove double acknowledgments
3. Simplify structure formulas
4. Fix "No problem!" usage
5. Shorten example responses
6. Simplify scaffolding progress responses
7. Add variable acknowledgment intensity
8. Enable natural transitions
9. Add numeric extraction for main problem detection during scaffolding
