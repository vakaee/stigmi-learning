# Workflow Rebuild Summary

**Date**: October 7, 2025
**Transformation**: Linear workflow → LangChain Agent architecture

---

## What Changed

### Nodes Removed (9)
1. Stage 1: Is Answer?
2. Parse Triage Result
3. If Answer
4. Verify Answer
5. Stage 2a: Answer Quality
6. Stage 2b: Non-Answer Intent
7. Parse Stage 2b
8. Enrich Context
9. Update Session & Format Response1 (duplicate)

### Nodes Added (7)
1. **OpenAI Chat Model** - LangChain chat model for agent
2. **Window Buffer Memory** - Automatic conversation history (last 5 turns)
3. **Tool: Verify Main Answer** - Numeric verification for main problem answers
4. **Tool: Validate Scaffolding** - Semantic validation for scaffolding question responses
5. **Prepare Agent Context** - Detects scaffolding mode, builds context
6. **AI Agent** - LangChain agent with decision tree logic
7. **Parse Agent Output** - Parses agent JSON response

### Nodes Modified (1)
- **Update Session & Format Response** - Removed manual conversation history management (Memory node handles this now)

### Final Count
- **Total nodes**: 20 (was 22)
- **Deleted**: 9
- **Added**: 7
- **Unchanged**: 13

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Linear Flow)
```
Normalize → Load Session → Stage 1 Triage → If/Else Branch
  → Verify Answer → Stage 2a Classification
  → Stage 2b Intent Classification
  → Enrich Context → Route → Response → Update Session
```

### After (Agent-Based)
```
Normalize → Load Session → Prepare Agent Context → AI Agent
  ├─ OpenAI Chat Model (sub-node)
  ├─ Window Buffer Memory (sub-node)
  ├─ Tool: Verify Main Answer (sub-node)
  └─ Tool: Validate Scaffolding (sub-node)
→ Parse Agent Output → Route → Response → Update Session
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Scaffolding Question Awareness
**Problem**: Student response "to the left of 0?" was validated against main answer "2" → classified as off-topic

**Solution**:
- Prepare Agent Context detects if last tutor message was a scaffolding question
- Agent uses `validate_scaffolding` tool for semantic validation
- Only main problem attempts use numeric `verify_main_answer` tool

### 2. Smart Attempt Counting
**Before**: All answers incremented attempt_count

**After**: Only `is_main_problem_attempt: true` increments count
- Scaffolding responses don't increment
- Conceptual questions don't increment
- Off-topic messages don't increment

### 3. Automatic Memory Management
**Before**: Manual `recent_turns` array management in Update Session

**After**: Window Buffer Memory sub-node handles conversation history automatically
- Tracks last 5 turns
- Provides context to agent
- Session object simplified (no more manual history tracking)

## New Agent Decision Tree

The AI Agent follows this logic:

1. **IF scaffolding_active**:
   - Check if new question → `conceptual_question`
   - Else → Use `validate_scaffolding` tool
     - If correct/partially_correct → `scaffold_progress` (routes to stuck template)
     - If incorrect → `stuck`

2. **ELSE IF looks like answer**:
   - Use `verify_main_answer` tool
     - If correct → `correct`
     - If close (within 20%) → `close`
     - If wrong → `wrong_operation`

3. **ELSE IF conceptual question** → `conceptual_question`

4. **ELSE IF stuck** → `stuck`

5. **ELSE** → `off_topic`

## Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Scaffolding Question Response
```
Input: "8"
Expected: category "wrong_operation", attempt_count: 1

Tutor: "What does -3 mean on a number line?"

Input: "to the left of 0?"
Expected:
- category: "stuck" (from scaffold_progress)
- is_main_problem_attempt: false
- attempt_count: 1 (not incremented)
- tool_used: "validate_scaffolding"
```

### Test 2: Return to Main Answer
```
Input: "2"
Expected:
- category: "correct"
- is_main_problem_attempt: true
- attempt_count: 2 (incremented)
- tool_used: "verify_main_answer"
```

### Test 3: Conceptual Question During Scaffolding
```
(While scaffolding active)
Input: "What's a number line?"
Expected:
- category: "conceptual_question"
- is_main_problem_attempt: false
- tool_used: "none"
```

## Known Uncertainties (to verify during testing)

1. **Tool parameter syntax**: Using `$input.student_answer` - may need adjustment
2. **SystemMessage templating**: Using `{{ $json.X }}` - might not support templating
3. **Memory sessionKey access**: Using `={{ $json.session_id }}` - verify sub-node has access
4. **Agent output format**: Expecting JSON, might get plain text without Output Parser sub-node
5. **Connection type names**: Using `ai_languageModel`, `ai_memory`, `ai_tool` - confirmed from research but untested

## Files Modified

- `workflow-production-ready.json` - Rebuilt with LangChain architecture
- `workflow-production-ready.backup.json` - Backup of original (created)
- `AGENT-WORKFLOW-IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Deleted (temporary reference)
- `AGENT-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md` - Deleted (temporary reference)

---

## Next Steps

1. Import `workflow-production-ready.json` into n8n
2. Verify all node connections are correct
3. Run Test 1: Scaffolding question scenario
4. If issues found, adjust tool syntax, agent config, or add Output Parser sub-node
5. Document any fixes needed

---

## Rollback Plan

If the new workflow doesn't work:
```bash
cp workflow-production-ready.backup.json workflow-production-ready.json
```

This restores the original linear workflow.

**Status**: Ready for testing in n8n
