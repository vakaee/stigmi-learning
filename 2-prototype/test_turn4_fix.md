# Turn 4 Fix Verification - "45" Conversation

## Original Bug (Turn 4)
**Student**: "I don't know"  
**Context**: teach_back.active = true (wrongly activated in turn 3)  
**Old Response**: "That's okay! The important thing is you got the right answer."  
**Problem**: Student NEVER gave "2" as answer - false praise

## Fixed Behavior (Turn 4)
**Student**: "I don't know"  
**Context**: teach_back.active = true  
**New Response**: 
- Acknowledge: "That's okay!"
- Provide solution: "What is -3 + 5? = 2"
- Brief explanation using problem numbers

**Result**: Student now gets the actual solution instead of false celebration

## Remaining Issues (Turns 1-3)
The turn 4 fix addresses the SYMPTOM, but root causes remain:

**Turn 1**: "45" classified as "wrong_operation" 
- Should be: "stuck" (not a plausible wrong operation)

**Turn 2**: "subtract" (WRONG conceptual answer)
- Detected as keyword but NOT validated for correctness
- Should be: "stuck" (wrong answer to "are we adding or subtracting?")

**Turn 3**: "adding" (CORRECT scaffolding answer)
- Misrouted to main problem verification
- Classified as "correct" (main problem solved)
- Wrongly activated teach-back
- Should be: "scaffold_progress" with is_main_problem_attempt=false

## Status
- Turn 4 fix: COMPLETE
- Turns 1-3 bugs: IDENTIFIED, awaiting fix
