## Overview

The Option A architecture implements a **multi-agent orchestration system** that combines:
- **3 specialized LLM calls** with different temperature settings
- **4 rule-based validators** for deterministic classification
- **Hybrid intelligence** balancing speed and flexibility
- **Context-aware routing** adapting to conversation state

This is NOT a single-LLM system. It's a **coordinated ensemble** where different components handle different aspects of the tutoring flow.

---

## Multi-Agent Orchestration

### The Three LLM Agents

#### 1. Content Feature Extractor (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, temp 0.1)
**Purpose**: Deterministic feature extraction from student messages

**What it does**:
- Extracts `message_type`: answer_attempt | conceptual_response | question | help_request | off_topic
- Extracts `numeric_value` from answers (handles "5 steps" → 5, "we get 2" → 2)
- Extracts `keywords` from conceptual responses
- Returns `confidence` score

**Why temperature 0.1**: Deterministic classification, no creativity needed

**Input**:
```json
{
  "message": "I followed what you told me and got to 2",
  "current_problem": {"text": "What is -3 + 5?", "correct_answer": "2"}
}
```

**Output**:
```json
{
  "message_type": "answer_attempt",
  "numeric_value": 2,
  "keywords": null,
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```

**When it runs**: Every turn (always first)

---

#### 2. Synthesis Detector (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, temp 0.1)
**Purpose**: Prevent infinite scaffolding loops

**What it does**:
- Analyzes last 5 conversation turns
- Detects if tutor is asking same scaffolding question repeatedly
- Returns: continue_scaffolding | provide_synthesis | exit_scaffolding

**Why temperature 0.1**: Deterministic loop detection, no creativity needed

**Input**:
```json
{
  "recent_turns": ["Turn 1...", "Turn 2...", "Turn 3..."],
  "current_problem": {...}
}
```

**Output**:
```json
{
  "decision": "provide_synthesis",
  "reasoning": "Tutor asked 'Are we adding or subtracting?' 3 times",
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```

**When it runs**: During scaffolding, after 3+ turns

---

#### 3. Response Generator (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, temp 0.3)
**Purpose**: Generate pedagogically appropriate tutor responses

**What it does**:
- Takes classification category (correct, stuck, wrong_operation, etc.)
- Uses conversation history for context
- Adapts response based on attempt count
- Applies age-appropriate language

**Why temperature 0.3**: Balance between consistency and natural conversation

**Input**:
```json
{
  "category": "teach_back_explanation",
  "message": "I followed what you told me and got to 2",
  "current_problem": {...},
  "chat_history": "...",
  "attempt_count": 1
}
```

**Output**:
```
Great job explaining! You followed the steps and got to 2. Well done!
```

**When it runs**: Every turn (always last)

---

### Why Three Agents?

**Separation of Concerns**:
- **Feature Extraction**: Pure information extraction (no pedagogy)
- **Synthesis Detection**: Meta-level loop detection (no content analysis)
- **Response Generation**: Pedagogical reasoning (no classification)

**Performance**:
- Feature Extractor: ~300ms (lightweight, temp 0.1)
- Synthesis Detector: ~200ms (only runs during scaffolding)
- Response Generator: ~800ms (creative generation, temp 0.3)

**Total LLM time**: ~1.3 seconds per turn (vs 2.5+ seconds for single GPT-4 call)

---

## Hybrid Intelligence Approach

The system combines **deterministic rules** with **LLM reasoning**:

### Rule-Based Validators (Fast, Deterministic)

#### 1. Enhanced Numeric Verifier
**Handles**: Numeric answer verification with operation error detection

**Rules**:
```javascript
if (|student_value - correct_value| < 0.001) → correct
else if (|student_value - correct_value| / |correct_value| < 0.2) → close
else if (student_value in ERROR_DETECTORS[problem_type]) → wrong_operation
else → stuck
```

**Example**:
```
Problem: -3 + 5 = ?
Student: "8"
Operation errors: [8, -8, 8, -2]  // forgot negatives, subtracted, abs, wrong sign
8 is in list → wrong_operation
```

**Why rule-based**: Math verification is deterministic, no ambiguity

---

#### 2. Semantic Validator
**Handles**: Conceptual answers with pattern matching

**Rules**:
```javascript
SEMANTIC_PATTERNS['math_operation_identification'] = {
  questionPatterns: ['adding or subtracting', 'add or subtract'],
  expectedKeywords: {
    '+': ['adding', 'add', 'plus'],
    '-': ['subtracting', 'subtract', 'minus']
  },
  wrongKeywords: {
    '+': ['subtracting', 'subtract'],
    '-': ['adding', 'add']
  }
}
```

**Example**:
```
Problem: -3 + 5 (has '+')
Student: "adding"
Expected keywords for '+': ['adding', 'add', 'plus']
Match found → scaffold_progress
```

**Why rule-based**: Keyword matching is fast and accurate for known patterns

**Fallback to LLM**: Sets `_needs_llm_validation: true` for ambiguous cases

---

#### 3. Classify Stuck
**Handles**: Help requests and off-topic messages

**Rules**:
```javascript
return {
  category: 'stuck',
  confidence: 1.0,
  reasoning: 'Help request or unclear response'
}
```

**Why rule-based**: Simplest case, no complex reasoning needed

---

#### 4. Teach-Back Validator
**Handles**: Distinguishing explanation attempts from help requests during teach-back

**Rules**:
```javascript
const helpPatterns = ["i don't know", "dont know", "not sure", "help", "stuck"];
const explanationPatterns = ['i followed', 'i got', 'because', 'first', 'then'];

if (helpPatterns.some(p => message.includes(p))) → stuck
else if (explanationPatterns.some(p => message.includes(p))) → teach_back_explanation
else → stuck (ambiguous, default to help)
```

**Example**:
```
Message: "I followed what you told me and got to 2"
Matches: 'i followed', 'i got'
→ teach_back_explanation
```

**Why rule-based**: Pattern detection is sufficient for most cases

---

### LLM-Based Components (Flexible, Context-Aware)

**Content Feature Extractor**:
- Handles edge cases like "5 steps" → numeric_value: 5
- Extracts semantic meaning beyond simple patterns
- Handles multiple numbers in one message

**Synthesis Detector**:
- Analyzes conversation patterns across multiple turns
- Detects subtle loops (rephrasing same question)
- Meta-reasoning about tutoring effectiveness

**Response Generator**:
- Adapts tone to student's emotional state
- Generates creative examples and explanations
- Balances pedagogy with empathy

---

### Why Hybrid?

| Approach | Speed | Accuracy | Flexibility | Cost |
|----------|-------|----------|-------------|------|
| Pure LLM | Slow | Good | High | High |
| Pure Rules | Fast | Good (known cases) | Low | Low |
| **Hybrid** | **Fast** | **Excellent** | **Medium** | **Medium** |

**Hybrid wins** by using rules for known patterns (80% of cases) and LLMs for edge cases and creative generation.

## State Machine Design

### States

```
┌─────────────────┐
│     NORMAL      │  Initial state, main problem active
│                 │  - Verifies main problem attempts
│  attempt_count  │  - Routes based on message type
│  scaffolding:   │  - No special routing
│    active:false │
│  teach_back:    │  Transitions:
│    active:false │  → SCAFFOLDING (stuck, attempt >= 2)
└─────────────────┘  → TEACH_BACK (correct answer)
        ↓                      ↑
        ↓                      │
┌─────────────────┐           │
│   SCAFFOLDING   │           │
│                 │           │
│  scaffolding:   │           │
│    active:true  │           │
│    question:    │  Transitions:
│    attempt:0    │  → NORMAL (correct sub-answer)
│  teach_back:    │  → TEACH_BACK (correct main answer)
│    active:false │  → SCAFFOLDING (wrong sub-answer, attempt++)
└─────────────────┘
        ↓
        ↓
┌─────────────────┐
│   TEACH_BACK    │
│                 │
│  teach_back:    │
│    active:true  │
│    question:    │  Transitions:
│  scaffolding:   │  → NORMAL (explanation complete OR help request)
│    active:false │
└─────────────────┘
```

### State Transitions

#### NORMAL → SCAFFOLDING
**Trigger**: `category == 'stuck' && attempt_count >= 2`

**Updates**:
```javascript
session.current_problem.scaffolding = {
  active: true,
  question: "Are we adding or subtracting the numbers?",
  attempt: 0,
  parent_attempt: session.current_problem.attempt_count
}
```

**Routing Changes**:
- Numeric answers: Use scaffolding heuristic (proximity-based)
- Conceptual answers: Route to Semantic Validator

---

#### SCAFFOLDING → NORMAL
**Trigger**: `category == 'scaffold_progress' && all sub-questions answered`

**Updates**:
```javascript
session.current_problem.scaffolding.active = false
session.current_problem.attempt_count++ // Resume main problem
```

**Routing Changes**:
- Revert to normal routing (no heuristic)

---

#### NORMAL → TEACH_BACK
**Trigger**: `category == 'correct'`

**Updates**:
```javascript
session.current_problem.teach_back = {
  active: true,
  question: "Can you explain how you got that answer?"
}
```

**Routing Changes**:
- All messages route to Teach-Back Validator (unless explicit help request)

---

#### TEACH_BACK → NORMAL
**Trigger**: `category == 'teach_back_explanation' || category == 'stuck'`

**Updates**:
```javascript
session.current_problem.teach_back.active = false
session.current_problem.completed = true
session.current_problem.attempt_count = 0
```

**Routing Changes**:
- Revert to normal routing
- Problem marked complete

---

### State-Dependent Routing

The **Content-Based Router** adapts its logic based on state:

```javascript
const teachBackActive = session?.current_problem?.teach_back?.active;
const scaffoldingActive = session?.current_problem?.scaffolding?.active;

let route;

if (teachBackActive) {
  // Special teach-back routing
  if (messageType === 'help_request') {
    route = 'classify_stuck';
  } else {
    route = 'teach_back_validator';
  }
} else if (messageType === 'answer_attempt') {
  if (scaffoldingActive) {
    // Scaffolding heuristic: proximity-based routing
    const isLikelyMainProblem = Math.abs(numericValue - correctAnswer) < threshold;
    route = isLikelyMainProblem ? 'verify_numeric' : 'validate_conceptual';
  } else {
    // Normal routing
    route = 'verify_numeric';
  }
} else if (messageType === 'conceptual_response') {
  route = 'validate_conceptual';
} else {
  route = 'classify_stuck';
}
```

**Key insight**: Same input ("5") routes differently based on state:
- NORMAL: verify_numeric (check if correct answer)
- SCAFFOLDING: validate_conceptual (check if correct sub-answer)

---

## Context-Aware Routing

### The Scaffolding Heuristic

**Problem**: During scaffolding, how do we know if "5" is:
- Answer to scaffolding sub-question (e.g., "How many steps total?")
- Attempt at main problem (student trying to exit scaffolding)

**Solution**: Proximity-based heuristic

```javascript
// Main problem: -3 + 5 = 2
const numericValue = 5;
const correctAnswer = 2;
const diff = Math.abs(numericValue - correctAnswer); // 3
const threshold = Math.max(Math.abs(correctAnswer * 0.5), 1); // max(1, 1) = 1

const isLikelyMainProblem = diff < threshold; // 3 < 1 = false

// Route to validate_conceptual (sub-answer)
```

**Example Cases**:

| Message | Main Answer | Diff | Threshold | Route | Reasoning |
|---------|-------------|------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| "2" | 2 | 0 | 1 | verify_numeric | Exit scaffolding |
| "5 steps" | 2 | 3 | 1 | validate_conceptual | Sub-answer |
| "8" | 2 | 6 | 1 | validate_conceptual | Sub-answer |
| "1.8" | 2 | 0.2 | 1 | verify_numeric | Close, exit scaffolding |

**Why it works**:
- Main problem attempts cluster near correct answer
- Sub-answers are typically far from main answer (different magnitude)
- Threshold (50% of answer, min 1) balances sensitivity

---

### Teach-Back Routing

**Problem**: During teach-back, "I don't know" vs "I followed the steps and got 2" need different responses.

**Solution**: Pattern-based routing to Teach-Back Validator

```javascript
if (teachBackActive) {
  if (messageType === 'help_request') {
    // Explicit help request detected by Feature Extractor
    route = 'classify_stuck';
  } else {
    // Could be explanation attempt, let validator decide
    route = 'teach_back_validator';
  }
}
```

**Teach-Back Validator Logic**:
```javascript
const helpPatterns = ["i don't know", "not sure", "help", "stuck"];
const explanationPatterns = ['i followed', 'i got', 'because', 'first'];

if (helpPatterns.some(p => message.includes(p))) {
  return {category: 'stuck'}; // Provide solution
} else if (explanationPatterns.some(p => message.includes(p))) {
  return {category: 'teach_back_explanation'}; // Acknowledge explanation
}
```

**Why separate validator**: Teach-back requires different patterns than normal classification.

---

## Configuration-Driven Validation

### ERROR_DETECTORS Registry

**Purpose**: Define plausible operation errors per problem type

**Structure**:
```javascript
ERROR_DETECTORS = {
  'math_arithmetic_addition': (num1, num2, operation) => [
    Math.abs(num1) + Math.abs(num2),  // Forgot negatives
    num1 - num2,                       // Subtracted instead
    Math.abs(num1 - num2),             // Absolute value
    -(num1 + num2)                     // Wrong sign
  ]
}
```

**Usage**:
```javascript
// Problem: -3 + 5 = 2
// Student: "8"
const errors = ERROR_DETECTORS['math_arithmetic_addition'](-3, 5, '+');
// errors = [8, -8, 8, -2]
if (errors.includes(8)) {
  category = 'wrong_operation'; // Match found
}
```

**Extensibility**:
```javascript
// Add chemistry support
ERROR_DETECTORS['chemistry_ph_calculation'] = (h_concentration) => [
  7 - h_concentration,           // Reversed pH scale
  -Math.log10(h_concentration)   // Forgot negative sign
];
```

---

### SEMANTIC_PATTERNS Registry

**Purpose**: Define expected keywords for conceptual questions

**Structure**:
```javascript
SEMANTIC_PATTERNS = {
  'math_operation_identification': {
    patterns: [{
      questionPatterns: ['adding or subtracting', 'add or subtract'],
      expectedKeywords: {
        '+': ['adding', 'add', 'plus'],
        '-': ['subtracting', 'subtract', 'minus']
      },
      wrongKeywords: {
        '+': ['subtracting', 'subtract'],
        '-': ['adding', 'add']
      }
    }]
  }
}
```

**Usage**:
```javascript
// Problem has '+' operation
// Student: "adding"
const pattern = SEMANTIC_PATTERNS['math_operation_identification'];
const expected = pattern.expectedKeywords['+'];
const wrong = pattern.wrongKeywords['+'];

if (expected.some(kw => message.includes(kw))) {
  category = 'scaffold_progress'; // Correct
} else if (wrong.some(kw => message.includes(kw))) {
  category = 'stuck'; // Wrong
}
```

**Extensibility**:
```javascript
// Add history support
SEMANTIC_PATTERNS['history_time_period'] = {
  patterns: [{
    questionPatterns: ['before or after', 'earlier or later'],
    expectedKeywords: {
      'before_1500': ['medieval', 'middle ages'],
      'after_1500': ['renaissance', 'modern']
    }
  }]
}
```

---

### Why Configuration Over Hardcoding?

**Before** (Hardcoded):
```javascript
if (problem.text.includes('+') && student_answer == '8') {
  return 'wrong_operation'; // Hardcoded for -3 + 5
}
```

**After** (Configured):
```javascript
const detector = ERROR_DETECTORS[problem.type];
const errors = detector(problem.num1, problem.num2, problem.operation);
if (errors.includes(student_answer)) {
  return 'wrong_operation'; // Works for any arithmetic
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Add new subjects without modifying workflow
- Update error patterns without code changes
- Test patterns in isolation
- Share configurations across deployments

---

## Node Architecture

### Classification Path (7 nodes)

```
Load Session
    ↓
Content Feature Extractor (LLM)
    ↓
Merge (with Load Session)
    ↓
Content-Based Router (Code)
    ↓
Route by Content Type (Switch)
    ├─ verify_numeric → Enhanced Numeric Verifier (Code)
    ├─ validate_conceptual → Semantic Validator (Code)
    ├─ classify_stuck → Classify Stuck (Code)
    └─ teach_back_validator → Teach-Back Validator (Code)
```

**Key Design**: Only ONE validator executes per turn (based on routing).

---

### Response Path (6 nodes)

```
Build Response Context (Code)
    ↓
Synthesis Detector (LLM)
    ↓
Parse Synthesis Decision (Code)
    ↓
Route by Category (Switch)
    ↓
Response: Unified (LLM)
    ↓
Update Session & Format Response (Code)
```

**Key Design**: All categories converge to single Response: Unified node.

---

### Total Node Count

**Classification**: 7 nodes
**Response**: 6 nodes
**Infrastructure**: 12 nodes (webhook, Redis, debugging)

**Total**: 25 nodes (down from 28 in dual system)

---

## Performance Characteristics

### Latency Breakdown

| Component | Time | Type | Temperature |
|-----------|------|------|-------------|
| Load Session | 50ms | I/O | - |
| Content Feature Extractor | 300ms | LLM | 0.1 |
| Merge | 10ms | Code | - |
| Content-Based Router | 20ms | Code | - |
| Route by Content Type | 5ms | Switch | - |
| Validator (rule-based) | 15ms | Code | - |
| Build Response Context | 10ms | Code | - |
| Synthesis Detector | 200ms | LLM | 0.1 |
| Route by Category | 5ms | Switch | - |
| Response Generator | 800ms | LLM | 0.3 |
| Update Session | 30ms | Code | - |
| **Total** | **1.45s** | - | - |

**Target**: ≤3.5 seconds
**Actual**: ~1.45 seconds
**Margin**: 2.05 seconds (58% under budget)

---

### Token Usage

| LLM Call | Input Tokens | Output Tokens | Cost/Turn |
|----------|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| Content Feature Extractor | ~200 | ~50 | $0.00003 |
| Synthesis Detector | ~500 | ~100 | $0.00007 |
| Response Generator | ~800 | ~200 | $0.00012 |
| **Total** | **~1500** | **~350** | **$0.00022** |

**Monthly cost** (1M turns): ~$220

---

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Parallel Execution**: Load Session + Feature Extraction run concurrently
2. **Temperature Tuning**: Use 0.1 for deterministic tasks (faster inference)
3. **Token Limits**: Set max_tokens on each LLM call
4. **Rule-Based Fast Path**: 80% of turns use rules (15ms vs 300ms)
5. **Async Session Save**: Don't block response on session write

---

## Strengths & Weaknesses

---

### Weaknesses

**1. n8n Platform Limitations**
- Vendor lock-in (workflow tied to n8n)
- Limited testing infrastructure
- Debugging requires running full workflow

**2. Hardcoded Thresholds**
- 20% threshold for "close" answers
- 50% threshold for scaffolding heuristic
- May not generalize to all problem types

**3. Pattern Coverage**
- ERROR_DETECTORS only covers arithmetic operations
- SEMANTIC_PATTERNS only covers basic concepts
- New subjects require manual pattern definition

**4. No Learning**
- System doesn't improve from student interactions
- Patterns must be manually updated
- No personalization per student

**5. Single Language**
- All patterns and prompts in English
- Keyword matching breaks with other languages
- Would need complete rewrite for i18n

---

### Mitigation Strategies

**For n8n limitations**:

- Core logic in JavaScript (portable)
- API contract maintained for backward compatibility

**For hardcoded thresholds**:
- Thresholds in config variables (easy to tune)
- A/B testing framework planned for Phase 2
- Analytics to track classification accuracy

**For pattern coverage**:
- Registry architecture allows incremental addition
- Community contributions possible
- LLM fallback for uncovered cases

**For lack of learning**:
- Analytics pipeline to identify patterns
- Manual pattern updates based on logs
- Fine-tuned model planned for Phase 2

**For single language**:
- i18n registry architecture planned
- Translation layer for keywords
- Multi-lingual LLM calls (GPT-4 supports 50+ languages)
